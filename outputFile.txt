And will not let belief take hold of him
But, as it is, this pied collection
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
I prize the attention of my friends,
That if again this apparition come,
Therefore I have entreated him along
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
and only wish that my employment
begs your indulgence -- it's been spun
could have been turned to worthier ends --
from threads both sad and humoristic,
in limpid verse that lives and gleams.
in simple but sublime reflection,
of powers unripe, or on the wane,
of reason's icy intimations,
of sleeplessness, faint inspirations,
products of carefree hours, of fun,
themes popular or idealistic,
worthier of you in the perfection
your soul displays, in holy dreams,
